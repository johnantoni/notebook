### Hosting Companies I've had poor experiences with, why and when

* iWeb (poor customer service, long downtime) 2011
* Bluehost (oversold boxes, limited mysql resources resulting in downed sites) 2012-2013
* Dreamhost (hacked boxes) 2011

### Hosting Companies I've had good experiences with, why and when

* RamNode (good service, strong tech support, fast kvm boxes) 2013
* Linode (dependable) 2009-2013
* SSDVirt (same as ramnode, tech support doesn't sleep) 2013
