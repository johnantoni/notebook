main points are:

1. clean your hands thoroughly before using them
2. place them to one side and not contaminate the area with anything extra, spray etc.
3. make sure you have no distractions and quiet to put them in / take them out.

if any discomfort arises out of the ordinary, pain etc. however minute that you don't normally experience go to the eye doctor.

99% of times you'll be fine.

above all, if it hurts somethings wrong as it shouldnt.
