## Bikes

### safety rules

* get a bell
* get a helmet

* Watch for taxi's, buses, trucks or anything that's bigger than you. if you see a person on a mobile or with a dog give them a wide berth as the dog may get excited and run towards your bike.
* Never cycle faster than you can keep control of the bike, showing off will get you killed.
* If you're in a car and you hit a kid above 30 they're dead, think of what a bike would do.
* Make sure your helmet is secure, if you fall off and crack the styrofoam helmets then throw it away and get another one.

### two types of tyres

One is the European type with small valves.
The other is the American type with larger valves, if you fit a euro to an american rim you'll have more chance of nipping it at the valve end when you pump it up.

### pumps

Make sure you get the right pump for the job. the small high-pressure ones are usually for suspension bikes which rely on high pressure and are unsuitable for non-suspension wheels.

Get a standing pump, it's quick, easy and you won't be there forever pumping it up.

### spoon method

The age-old method of removing a bike tyre with spoons, like your dad taught you is bad news. You'll more than likely end up catching the inner tube and piercing the tyre or damaging the outer casing.

Get some plastic tyre levers, they're smooth all around so less chance of nipping the wheel and designed for the job.

### replacing a tyre

1. get your plastic tyre levers.
2. push one in about 6mm to get under the tyre and pull one side out, what you want to do is get one side of the tyre out.
3. with the tyre lever now run it around the entire tyre getting one rim of the tyre outside the steel rim.
4. once you've done that bend the tyre back and pull out the inner tube then pull it out all around the wheel, get the flat inner out and throw it away.
5. get your replacement tyre and get the valve in first then start feeding the inner tube into the rubber tyre.
6. once the inner is in the tyre use the tyre levers to lever the tyre back into the steel rim.
7. make sure you don't nip the inner as you do it.
8. once you've got it in pump it up a little bit, check for leaks (in case you nipped the inner) and once your satisfied pump it up all the way and pop it back on the bike.

### pumping up a tyre

with presta's you never need to screw the pump into the tyre, just push in the valve end of the pump and flip back the lever then pump away.

most tyres accept 65psi but check what you're accepts, don't pump it up too much or it'll explode.

### quick release

quick release wheels are great when you've got a flat, without them they're a PITA to replace a flat.

remember quick releases are actually cam's and you don't need to tighten the wheel in really hard, just get it in just so and push the lever back.
